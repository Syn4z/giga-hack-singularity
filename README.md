# EnergyTech Challenge ‚Äì UNDP

**Challenge details:** With Moldova‚Äôs planned deployment of over 100,000 household smart electricity meters, the energy sector is entering a transformative phase. But smart meters alone don‚Äôt guarantee smarter energy systems.

This challenge invited participants to build a prototype system that unlocks the potential of real-time consumption data. The solution must help energy providers monitor and manage grid load, anticipate peak demands, and provide actionable recommendations to consumers for more efficient and sustainable electricity use.

## ‚ö° Our Solution

We developed a **mobile application** that turns raw consumption data into actionable insights for everyday users.

### Main Features

- **Dashboard (Home Screen):**

  - Real-time and historical energy consumption graph
  - Monthly targets with progress indicators
  - Peak load highlights
  - Contextual recommendations for reducing consumption

- **Forecasts & Trends:**

  - Short-term consumption forecasts using ML models
  - Monthly/seasonal projections compared to user targets

- **Simulations:**

  - Consumption simulation based on different tariff plans
  - ‚ÄúWhat-if‚Äù scenarios to test savings potential

- **Gamification & Community:**
  - Reward points for efficient consumption
  - Leaderboards at household, street, and apartment-block level
  - Challenges to reduce peaks and hit targets
